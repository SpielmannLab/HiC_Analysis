### output folders for the samples
### OUTS can be one or multiple of "bowtie_results", "hic_results", "matrix" or "hic_format" 
### matrix, bowtie_results and hic_results are created by running hicpro 
### there is no advantage of excluding any of the three, except then
### (1) hicpro scripts for step 1 and step 2 are altered to exclude matrix generation - exclude "matrix"
### (2) the bam files are not required and can get deleted - exclude "bowtie_results"
### "hic_format" works with copied hic results and won't restart hicpro if "hic_results" were copied already
OUTS:
    - "matrix" 
    - "bowtie_results"
    - "hic_results"
    - "hic_format"
