# arrowhead settings #
######################
# IMPORTANT: Arrowhead works only when you have at least 300M reads in the HiC file
# This kind of equates to about 1000 reads per bin at 10k resolution (bin size)
chromosome: # 14 # Optional. Comma separated. Eg. chr1,chr2,3,X. Leave empty to perform arrowhead on all chromosomes
sliding_window_size: 2000 # Slice of sliding window along diagonal. Must be an even number. Default is 2000
hic_resolution: 10000 # Which resolution to perform arrowhead on. Recommended 5000 or 10000
# Normalization is very version dependent.
# For hic files from juicer_2.20.00 available options are <NONE,SCALE,VC,VC_SQRT>. NOTE: KR is not available. Use SCALE instead
# You can also use juicer_tools validate command to check which normalizations are present
normalization: SCALE
juicer_path:
  # This is the name of the package that arrowhead is a part of. By Aiden lab
  # Make sure to use the version that matches the version of the hic file output by fastq2HiC
  name: juicer_2.20.00
