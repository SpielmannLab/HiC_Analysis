Most important thing is to keep track of normalizations when running hiccups. 

    # For *.hic files created using 1.19.02 with restriction fragements:
    # Hiccups normalization options:
    # -k NONE does not work
    # -k VC,SCALE,VC_SQRT, KR works
    # Not specifying -k option also works
    It looks like pre default is: VC,VC_SQRT,KR,SCALE. So, this makes sense

    # For *.hic files created using 1.19.02 without restriction fragements:
    # -k NONE does not work
    # -k VC,SCALE,VC_SQRT, KR works
    # Not specifying -k option also works
    It looks like pre default is: VC,VC_SQRT,KR,SCALE. So, this makes sense

    # For *.hic files created using 2.20.00 without restriction fragements:
    -k KR does not work
    -k VC,VC_SQRT,NONE,SCALE works
    # Not specifying -k option also works


    # When running hiccupsdiff, make sure that the exact same normalization option is used!
